In this project I have implemented most used shortest path algorithms (weighted and unweighted) in Graph Theory which can be visualized.

### Features

<ul>
<li>
Manually select a algorithm from the given list of most used algorithms.
</li>
<li>
Draw random mazes and random weights.
</li>
<li>
Source and destination can be dragged wherever needed.
</li>
<li>
Visualize the algorithm
</li>
</ul>
